# program_time_analysis
:zap::watch: This ipython script allows you to analyze the process of program optimization in terms of its execution time.

### Description:
Inside the notebook, there are constant values that can be changed for a specific project. The script receives a binary file to <b>check its speed</b> and <b>performs an experiment</b> with the specified selection. After long-term use of the script, you can analyze the results of optimizing a specific project.

### Example:
In this example, we analyzed the work of my <a href="https://github.com/zkerriga/miniRT">ray-racing project</a>, which required serious optimization:

### Issue:
There is not enough <b>control group</b> for the experiment, which will eliminate the time differences caused by the specifics of the personal computer.
